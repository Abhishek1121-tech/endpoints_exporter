Endpoints Exporter is a tool designed to collect and export endpoint availability and response time metrics. It can be used to monitor the health and performance of various services and APIs.

## Features

- Monitor multiple endpoints concurrently
- Record response time and HTTP status codes
- Export metrics in a format compatible with Prometheus

## Installation

    1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Abhishek1121-tech/endpoints_exporter.git
    cd endpoints_exporter

    2. Create Configuration:
        Edit the endpoints.yaml file to define the endpoints you want to monitor: Add your section in the endpoints_exporter_config.ini file. Prefix with Endpoint_ will be considered for health check.
        ```
        [Global]
        sleep_time = 300
        port = 8000

        [Endpoint_Example]
        url = https://example.com
        name = Example Website
        timeout = 10
        follow_redirects = false
        max_redirects = 5

        [EndpointTest]
        url = http://fakeurl.com
        name = Test Endpoint
        timeout = 10
        follow_redirects = true
        max_redirects = 5
        ```

    3. Build the Docker Image:
        Build the Docker image using the provided Dockerfile:
        ```bash
        docker build -t endpoints-monitor:0.0.1 .

    4. Run the Docker Container:
        Run the Docker container based on the image you just built: 
        ```bash
        docker run -p 8000:8000 endpoints-monitor:0.0.1 python endpoints_monitor.py --config /app/endpoints_exporter_config.ini

    5. Access Prometheus Metrics:
        The Prometheus metrics server is now running inside the Docker container. Access the metrics at http://localhost:8000/metrics in your web browser. These metrics can be scraped by Prometheus for monitoring and analysis.

    6. Metric currnetly exposed by exporter
        ```
        service_live_metric = Gauge('endpoint_service_live_status', 'Response code of the URL endpoint', ['url', 'name'])
        response_time_metric = Gauge('endpoint_response_time_seconds', 'Response time of the URL endpoint', ['url', 'name'])
        status_code_metric = Gauge('endpoint_status_code', 'HTTP Status code of the URL endpoint', ['url', 'name'])
        ```
        
## Customization
    Modify endpoints.yaml to add or remove endpoints for monitoring.
    Adjust the Dockerfile or application code according to your requirements.
